This is the code used for my Bachelor's Thesis 3rd Year Dissertation Project. It uses Python3 as the main language, with reliance on OPEN-CV for object recognition and remembering.

The main idea behind my unique form of maze-solving was to send a robot with 'eyes' (a camera) into a maze full of cluttered objects to recognise, 
measure and remember their compliance scores (how easy an object is to move), to then use this information again later when traversing the maze
to find the quickest and easiest path to the goal by moving itself (the robot) through the object instead of going all the way around.
